# Inventory Management System 🛒

A simple and effective inventory management system built in Python, designed to help small businesses and personal users manage stock, track items, and generate basic reports.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Item CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete inventory items.
- Stock tracking: Monitor available quantity and movement.
- Search & filter: Quickly find items by name, category, or identifier.
- Reorder alerts: Set minimum stock levels to be notified when items are low.
- Basic reporting: View inventory summaries and export CSV reports (optional).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Optional dependencies:
  - pandas – for CSV handling
  - tabulate – for pretty terminal output
- Data storage: In-memory or flat files (JSON/CSV), but easily replaceable with a database backend
